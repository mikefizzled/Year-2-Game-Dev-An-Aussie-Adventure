# Year 2 - Game Dev: An Aussie Adventure

A light-hearted 3D platformer prototype created in Unity, developed for the Games Development module.  
The project draws inspiration from classic mascot platformers such as *Crash Bandicoot* and *Banjo Kazooie* focusing on exploration, collection, and transformation-based progression.

The player takes the role of a shapeshifter who must regain their powers to lift a curse placed on their wife.  
Gameplay revolves around exploring the outback, collecting currency, purchasing potions, and unlocking animal transformations to overcome environmental challenges.

The game was designed to be family-friendly and focused on delivering a compact proof of concept for the genre.
